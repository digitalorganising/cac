# What's this about?

The **Central Arbitration Committee** (CAC) is an independent statutory body with a critical responsibility: adjudication on trade unions' applications for recognition under Part I of Schedule A1 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.

Although this process happens in the open and is conducted fastidiously by CAC panels, its details and requirements are opaque to most workers and many trade unionists. This project is an attempt to **document that process every time it happens**, and also to discover trends and patterns over the 25 years that it has been available.

If you want to talk to me about it, then email Jamie DOT Parkinson AT prospect.org.uk.

## What does it do?

- Extracts data from published CAC decisions using a Large Language Model
- Constructs an event timeline with that data
- Makes the data searchable and aggregatable
- Reflects published decisions **within an hour** of being updated
