## What do I want this to do

### Outcomes:

1. I can see a timeline of CAC outcomes with key information visible
2. I can search CAC outcomes
3. I can filter by entities (union, employer, panel member) and other information (final outcome)
4. I can view aggregated information about statutory recognition

### To do:

- [ ] Try some free text summary of applications
- [ ] Ingest plain docs into local Elasticsearch
- [ ] Write prompts + tests for all document types
- [ ] Pipeline for docs with extracted data
- [ ] Build interface for search & filter
- [ ] Dashboard or something?
